# Missing Return Statement in Next.js 15 Page Component

This repository demonstrates a common error in Next.js 15: a missing `return` statement in a page component.  Next.js 15's improved type checking will throw an error if a page component doesn't explicitly return JSX.

## Problem
The `pages/about.js` file is missing a `return` statement.  This causes a runtime error during the build process.  The error message isn't always clear, but it usually points to the missing return.

## Solution
The solution is simple: ensure every page component has an explicit `return` statement, even if it's just returning `null`.  In this case, the component was missing a return statement entirely, which is the root cause of the issue.

## How to reproduce
1. Clone this repository.
2. Run `npm install`.
3. Run `npm run dev`.
4. Observe the error in your terminal.
